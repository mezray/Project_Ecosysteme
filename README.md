<h1> SOLID principles </h1>
<h2> The Open–closed principle (OCP) </h2>

>  “Software entities … should be open for extension but closed for modification”

We can take as example different classes such as the classes present in "Entite" or "Inert" where we can add without complication new "animals/ plants/ meat/ waste". Or in the "herbivore/ carnivore/ plante/ objet/" classes where we can add new modules without modifying the code already done

<h2> The Liskov substitution principle (LSP)  </h2>

> “Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it”
